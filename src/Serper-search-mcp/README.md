}
```

## üõ† Usage

### Search Tool

The server provides a powerful search tool with the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  "query": string,          // Search query
  "numResults"?: number,    // Number of results (default: 10, max: 100)
  "gl"?: string,           // Country code (e.g., "us", "uk")
  "hl"?: string,           // Language code (e.g., "en", "es")
  "autocorrect"?: boolean, // Enable autocorrect (default: true)
  "type"?: "search"        // Search type (more types coming soon)
}
```

### Deep Research Tool

For more comprehensive research needs, the server provides a deep research tool that performs multi-step research with the following parameters:

```typescript
{
  "query": string,          // Research query or question
  "depth"?: "basic" | "standard" | "deep",  // Research depth (default: "standard")
  "maxSources"?: number     // Maximum sources to include (default: 10)
}
```

The deep research tool:
- Breaks down complex queries into focused sub-queries
- Executes multiple searches to gather comprehensive information
- Uses AI to synthesize information from multiple sources
- Formats results with proper citations and references
- Adapts its research strategy based on intermediate results
